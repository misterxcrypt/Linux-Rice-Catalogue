So long as you use RAII and don't use new and delete (or malloc and free and friends), it's very hard to make a memory leak in C++.\n\nthe only thing C excels at from my experience is compile time.",

        "body": "If you want to use all my dotfiles, you will need to use bspwm instead of awesome (because some scripts are bspwm specific). You can still use some of my config in awesome and some (or almost all of them) are also usable after some changes. If you want to download the whole repo  (the dotfiles) you can use git clone for this (like this in this case):  \n`git clone` [`https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles.git`](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles.git)\n\nYou can get the link in general on Github by pressing on the green button **Clone or download**, situated on the home page of a repository, and copy the link that will pop up. (Also make sure you have **git** installed) \n\nIf you want to download a specific script or config. Then go to to the script or config file (I will take this [dunstrc](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dunst/dunstrc) as example). Then click the on the button **Raw**, copy the link of the current page and then use this command (I will use the same example):  \n`curl -JO \"`[`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/master/.config/dunst/dunstrc`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/master/.config/dunst/dunstrc)`\"`  \n*You can also use wget instead, but it might not be installed by default. You might read the deffirence and make your own mind about it.*\n\nAnd for the most optimal compatibility, place the script in the same path and download all the content of the folder it's located in (except if it's the [.script](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/tree/master/.script) folder). For [dunstrc](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dunst/dunstrc)'s example the path is \\~/[dotfiles](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles)/[.config](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/tree/master/.config)/[dunst](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/dunst)/[dunstrc](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dunst/dunstrc). You can see the path [here](https://imgur.com/a/A1hdHlW). Then also download the content of the file's folder with their respective location (in this case everything that is in the dunst folder).\n\nI will say that not everything will be as straight forward as described. For example even here your Spotify notifications will not appear out of the box (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/haogs0/bspwm_i_have_spent_too_much_time_on_this/fvgl4ff/?context=3) if you want to make it work right now) and the discord.sh script notifies the bar with the workspaces icons. Like you can see in the first pic and last pic, it notifies the bar to show a red warning dot on top of the purple message icon.\n\nYou can wait for my wiki and guides if you want to use my dots with some better explanations(I will make them in a couple of weeks) **OR** you can always try to figure out my scripts, if you're too impatient. The latter can make a good learning experience in my opinion lol. ;)",

        "body": "I mean that's a good point you're making.I do tile windows from time to time, especially when I'm opening multiple instances of my terminal but that's in my opinion not a valid reason to use bspwm. I actually have other (personal) reasons to use it:\n\n1. I like a window/desktop manger over a desktop environment because I don't really like having applications, I don't use, sit around my computer and it would be a pain to remove them all hence I use arch btw ;)\n2. I like using shell scripts and I would like to get better at. That's why bspwm seemed like the perfect choice for this ( It's config is a shell script and it handles everything with the bspc command)\n3. I like how minimal bspwm is out of the box. It doesn't come with a bar and it doesn't handle the keybindings. Which is great. That makes it feel more modular and [independent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRVmfx4EWI0) and make it so I can easily move on to another program if I want to without that much of a pain.\n4. I love using my keyboard over my mouse ( although I like to use a mouse from time to time). That's why I also use qutebrowser (I'm a sucker for vim and it's keybindings).\n5. I love the way bspwm can handle windows (this is probably some basic wm capabilities). It make it easy to configure specific window behavior via bspc, external\\_rules or a script is running in the background that uses `bspc subscribe` (that command is probably my number one reason tbh). For example:\n\n* The window sticky (the window follows you on which ever workspace you change focus) and hide status, can be used to make a \"[scratchpad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-l7DnDbiiU&t=117s)\". This something I use ALL THE TIME (see in my third picture when I'm using it to update my system on the left corner). To make for example a mini terminal or calculator in the corner that I can hide or show at will to use a quick little command or calculate something, without needing to change workspaces and letting my main work keep its size and formation on the focused desktop\n* I use mpv to watch my youtube videos and thanks to bspwm and some scripts. I can make it so my video is  sticky in the corner at spawn (like [this](https://imgur.com/XLMcm3R)) or when I want it tiled or full screen it goes to its dedicated workspace. I can even make it so that if I open a second video it replaces the old video in the corners place an move it on the dedicate mpv workspace and pause it automatically while the new video is in the corner starting its foutage.\n\nHopefully this answer your question why I (or someone else) could use bspwm, instead of something else, if don't \"really\" the tiling feature. The tiling feature is still sweet even though I don't really use it as much as let say other wm users.",

I would say that that one can be sometimes buggy but it's usable imo. As long as you don't mess too much with the picom config file, everythnig should run smoothly. But if you really don't want any bug I would recommend  [sdhand/picom](https://github.com/sdhand/picom). (but this one doesn't have blur)",

The icons represent actually workspaces where the application should launch and not the app it self. So as long as you aren't focused on the workspace or no app is open on the workspace the icon won't show up.\n\nIf you use my [sxhkd](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc) file you could you use the following keybindings:alt + {i , o}              go to the {left,right} occupied workspacealt + shift + {i,o}    go to the {left,right} workspacealt gr + Enter         open terminalatl gr + Space        open dmenu applauncher\n\nI would recommend you to read the [sxhkdrc](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc) file so you know the key bindings. I put a comment above each keybinding and the bindings are categorized in 3 sections: BSPWM controls, Media keys and Applications.\n\nFinally the idea of clicking on the workspace icon to launch an application sounds pretty cool. So I will implement it and patch my repo for it. So you can navigate the workspaces with the scroll button and start the app by clicking on the icon.",

If you want to have the same effect with dunst mind you.\n\nFirst make sure you don't use an other notification server because otherwise weird stuff will happen and read this if you want to now more about notification server. (No need to use arch or read everything this only explains if you can replace your notification server and how).\n\nThen you can make this custome Spotify notification in two ways. The old way I did with in my opinion some down side and the way I do now (but it has more extra steps).\n\n# The old version:\n\n1. Make sure your setting *\"Show desktop notifications when the songs changes\"* is **on** under \"Display Options\" in the Spotify settings.\n2. Add this to the end of your dunstrc file:\n\n`[spotify]`  \n`appname = Spotify`  \n`format = \"<span foreground='#1DB954' font_desc='Ubuntu Mono 32'>\udb81\udcc7<span font_desc='Ubuntu Mono 14'> </span><b>Spotify</b> </span><span foreground='#FFFFFF' font_desc='Ubuntu Mono 4'>\\n \\n</span><span font_desc='Ubuntu Mono 22'><b>%b</b></span>\\n[ <span font_desc='Ubuntu Mono 20'><i>%s</i></span> ]\"`  \n`foreground = \"#FFFFFF\"`  \n`background = \"#191414\"`\n\nThat's it but I have some personal issues with this:\n\n1. The body (the bold text under *Spotify*) is the title including the album name\n2. Some songs have a too long title and I can't trim it down\n3. Spotify doesn't send a notification for all songs (for example: [\u3044\u304d\u306e\u3053\u308a\u25cf\u307c\u304f\u3089](https://open.spotify.com/track/6ad7bQ48TlqAgebCExUJVe?si=akhTpUAjRzCNBca50RIyOw), I think it's because of the dot but I'm not sure).\n\nBut my new way fixes all this problems and gives me more control over the Spotify notifications.\n\n# The current version:\n\n1. Make sure your setting *\"Show desktop notifications when the songs changes\"* is **off** under \"Display Options\" in the Spotify settings.\n2. Make sure you have playerctl (and dunst of course).\n3. Start this [SPTN.sh](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.script/SPTN.sh) script at boot. *This will make sure you get a notification each time the song changes.*\n4. Download/copy this [spotify.sh](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dunst/scripts/spotify.sh) script and place it in *\\~/.config/dunst/scripts/spotify.sh* (or on some other path if you prefer but you will need to modify the path accordingly in SPTN.sh and spotify.sh ).\n5. add an image [error.png](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dunst/scripts/error.png) on the path:  \n *\\~/.config/dunst/scripts/error.png*  (If you use an other path, change accordingly in spotify.sh )  \nIt's used as a fallback image in case the image failed to download with curl.  (An cover image called spt.png will be created on the path \\~*/.config/dunst/scripts/spt.jpeg* )\n6. Then add this at the end of your dunstrc:\n\n`[spotify]`  \n`body = *Spotify*`  \n`format = \"%b\\n[ <span font_desc='Ubuntu Mono 20'><i>%s</i></span> ]\"`  \n`background = \"#191414\"`\n\nIf you dont want your title and artist name being shorten as mine, then change/modify line 20 and 21 in the [spotify.sh](https://github.com/SwiftyChicken/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/dunst/scripts/spotify.sh) script.\n\nHope this help.

Its key features include **virtual keyboard support** and an **installation script**. This theme also support **animated wallpapers**.\n\nI was looking for a nice theme that uses qt6. But I couldn't find one, so I decided to use [MarianArlt's theme](https://github.com/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-dark) as a starting point to create my own modern theme that meets my needs. \nSince then I changed a lot of things:\n- ported project to qt6\n- added ability to set animated wallpapers (gifs, videos)\n- fixed virtual keyboard\n- changed the way objects are positioned (anchors to layout) \n- changed the way blur works\n- added installation script\n- added various themes\n- and many more fixes and improvements\n\nIf you like my work, please consider giving [star](https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme/tree/master) on github or leaving a [tip](https://ko-fi.com/keyitdev).\n\nIf you find a bug or have some suggestions feel free to open [issue](https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme/issues) on github.\nCheers!",

For the top titlebar there is enough space to draw 8px borders onto the titlebar, since the height is larger then 8px. The bottom bar instead only has a height of 3px (width inner border + width outer border), so there is only space to draw 3px border radius corners.

Copy all the pictures from the Atacama folder to Atacama-timed.\n3. Copy the Atacama-timed.xml from Atacama folder to /usr/share/backgrounds/gnome .\n4. Now go to /usr/share/gnome-background-properties .\n5. Make a copy of the file adwaita.xml and name it as Atacama.xml\n6. Open the Atacama.xml and change the path inside the <filename> tag to the path of your .xml file (in this case /usr/share/backgrounds/gnome/Atacama-timed.xml )\n7. reboot and BINGOO !! you will have your wallpaper in the backgrounds option in gnome-control-center.",

You can replace the startup by changing the i3config file (~/.config/i3/config) and change dmenu to \"rofi -show drun (example)\n2. Custom themes are changed also in the same config by adding -theme dark at the end of the startup line in i3config",

As for rainmeter, I believe that is windows only, so there's no reason to learn about it if you're going to use linux.\n\nNow, I hate that I can't provide a solid answer to how to learn about ricing because it's not a clearly defined process or skill (besides [shell scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script#:~:text=A%20shell%20script%20is%20a,program%20execution%2C%20and%20printing%20text) you should totally learn that). The way I've been going about it for 3 years at this point is:\n\n\\- Have some idea of what you want your desktop to look like\n\n\\- Search more specifically about how to achieve the look you want\n\n\\- Download necessary programs (like a window manager, status bar, notification manager, etc)\n\n\\- Learn how to configure those programs\n\n\\- Profit\n\nBut, since you're completely new, I'd say first just install linux and get used to it, you can do it alongside windows if you want to still use that OS. \n\nI don't think it's a good idea to install a new OS just to try to make it look good, so just try it out, see if you like it, and only then you'll naturally start learning about how you can customize it.\n\nHere are some useful links you can save somewhere:\n\n[How to install ubuntu (a user friendly linux distro)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_8cD4HFvhc)\n\n[How to install I3 on ubuntu (an easy to set up window manager)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dlrjaR6Xqg)\n\n[The arch wiki, an encyclopedia of all things linux (not just arch!)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)",

Only Gnome up until now, got obsessed with UI UX, created my own themes and extensions for Gnome too, but I wanted to try tiling WMs and while at it I wanted my own \"desktop environment\".\n\nWhat do you want to learn exactly? If it is only window managers you don't need another Partition/Virtual Machine. Just install your desired wm and run it, make sure you can launch a terminal and go from there.

        "body": "This comment might come in a bit late but I'll share a bit more info. \nFor sway I had to install sway-git and wlroots-git from AUR because x11 backend was [broken](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/issues/3556) otherwise. Hyperland-git doesn't use AUR wlroots-git, instead it will clone its own wlroots while installing. For hyprland-git I editted PKGBUILD and checkout wlroots to master and then build.  \n\nSince this nested WM from distrobox scenario is experimental and there are too many components involved, I want to mention that there were things that didn't go so smoothly:\n\nSTEAM CRASHES:\n  1. Currently making a window fullscreen will directly crash steam (black screen). I simply unbind the fullscreen key. Youtube can go fullscreen without a problem though. I seem to remember this was not a issue when I first started using sway in game mode about a month ago.\n  2. Steam Input setting screen is laggy because the setting is too complicated. Sometimes this crashes steam too.\n  3. Switching between WM and the game can sometimes crash steam. (decky loader pause plugin could help)\n\nI don't know what fixed it (steam update or wlroots-git?) but at least it's working now:\n  1. mouse wheel was not recognized (well wev showed the frame but no content)\n  2. SUPER key was not received at all\n  3. There were a time ctrl+c have a chance to crash steam too.\n\nNeeds workaround:\n  1. I had to start sway first, close it and then start hyprland so flatpaks will not complain about having no DISPLAY set. This may result from not having the same wlroots version in the two WM. It can also related to how gamescope and steam manages xwayland & DISPLAYs.\n  2. hyprland initial resolution: I had to set it to `monitor=,highrr,0x0,1` and then `exec-once hyprctl keyword monitor ,1280x800,0x0,1` or it would flash endlessly, seemingly switching between two resolutions. After this I can set background with swaybg.\n  3. podman can complain about not finding user root: launch again it will usually be fine.\n  4. After some serious crashes the container may fail to start. Thankfully almost everything is stored in $HOME/.config, I will just create a new container and run a script to install pacman/aur packages and I am back to where I left.\n\nKnown Limitation:\n  1. flatpaks from host will fail to open links/files from other apps: `Can't open portal file chooser: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod: No such interface \"org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser\" on object at path /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop\"` Steam deck has its own xdg-desktop-portal running with systemd. I am not familiar with flatpak/dbus/xdg-desktop-portal enough to make it work.",

My voxel renderer is extremely unoptimized and renders every vertex which is definitely not how Minecraft like games work. They do voxel meshing instead of just yeeting all the voxels to the GPU. I can probably drastically reduce GPU consumption by implementing meshing and backface culling. My renderer will be updating voxels at a much higher frequency than Minecraft, which changes the design considerations of the mesher, so I've been putting off thinking about that until I figure out all the mechanics it needs to support and get an unoptmized prototype finished.\n\nAs far as the lagginess of the video is concerned... that is a result of OBS trying to capture this in 1080p on my NUC.

I'm making a hacker hogwarts MMO on top of it, so the first release's final boss may require players to write the window manager for themselves in an hand-holdy tutorial way, effectively giving the player the source code. An interesting plotline I've been thinking up is that the hacker hogwarts is being threatened by a virus and to save the school the player has to write an alternate reality while in game and then jump into that alternate reality, effectively making it the active window manager and killing off the infected one (its just a plotline, not a real virus). This idea reminds me of rick and morty and would be an amazing way to end the first year of the hacker hogwarts MMO.\n2. I could just give the source code for personal use to people who buy the game or beat the game (without them having to build it themselves).\n3. I could just release it full open source.\n\nThe first option seems super appealing to me, because it would give people a reason to get and beat my game :), but I also understand the appeal of #3.

I would say it's configured in JavaScript but in reality you still have to code a gui from scratch, but it hides most of the boilerplate and allows for declaratively defined widgets, and because of this you have access to Gtk and other libraries too, and doesn't restrict you from anything.\nIt also has builtin stuff like audio and battery queries, a notification daemon and some other stuff so you don't have to write your own scripts.

You can use ncurses (or any other library) to get input and use assimp library to render any 3D object file you want. When I release this to github I'll also provide some examples ranging from basic to advanced usage.\n\n\nSo technically it can render any 3D object you throw at it but reading and parsing the file format is your responsibility (similar to opengl).",

These files contain the layout and colors of the windows and panels for each theme. To edit them, you can use the Linux program \"Inkscape\".\n\nHere's a video that might help you. You can find more information based on the details in the video.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=UgInK-WsUX8&t=451s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=UgInK-WsUX8&t=451s)\n\nI hope I've helped you, my friend, and I apologize if I can't give you more detailed information.

I downloaded reddit , searched the keyword \"porn\" . At that time I was not that horny, so I checked out every community with keyword porn in it. Unixporn? Never heard of that one before. I read some of the post and their title, didn't understand anything. So started googling and found Linux and Osx are unix like operating system. After some days, I was browsing youtube for ways to reduce the memory usage in my lowspec(2Gb, i3-4gen) computer. I came across some videos recommending Linux for low spec computers. I installed ubuntu in my computer. I started looking for commands. Youtube algorithm does its job and started recommending video from youtubers like distrotube, seytonic, mental outlaw, luke smith, etc. Kenny from mental outlaw helped me understand the privacy and security side(NSA Key, Intel management engine ...etc)of the linux. At that time I was also subscribed to Linux meme and started getting memes about \"arch supremacy\", lol. I installed manjaro, it ate up half of my memory. So I installed Arch on my laptop with the help of distrotube's arch installation video. On a fine day my professor(electrical) asked the class \"did anybody have experience with Linux commands, I need to install an electrical related simulation software on collage computer (ubuntu)\". From then I have converted two of my friend with low spec computer into Linux users. People around me started asking \"you are from the electrical background how do you know these things.\" I started recalling the starting point. All this time I was in the unixporn community, looking at beautiful ricings and thought it would be funny if I posted my story on r/unixporn.\n\nI have seen some comments in the past technically criticizing some custom themes (ex: solarized) . so I didn't expected these many people to find it funny.\n\nEnglish is not my first language, so please excuse any mistakes.",

Most of these programs are either outdated or using old libraries with literally no guides or documentation. I learned basic C first after that I just browsed open source programs and try to understand how they wrote it. I think I probably installed arch linux (without installer) like 40 times to my laptop because it has amd cpu and nvidia gpu which is a pain in the ass. Just learn basic C then inspect great programs like dwm, st you will learn it time by time. As for another opinion, normally everybody uses git apply or flexipatch build to customize their own dwm. I have never used  git apply patch before, I always patched line by line myself which I think helped me the most",

This way, you'll become familiar with these applications without leaving a familiar environment and learn how to use dotfiles and scripts.\n\n\\- to boot into WMs like i3 (i.e. a WM other than your main WM like KDE or Gnome) you need to simply install it like you install any other software in your distribution and then select this new WM in the login menu (it should appear there as a new option). In case of some WMs (for example Hyprland, which I strongly recommend) it will need to be launched from TTY for now.\n\n\\- Then, the \"dotfiles\" are simply config files which you need to place in your config directory (usually HOME/.config/nameoftheprogram). For each program it's a bit different story though. Some programs just take one config file, some other programs will also use additional scripts (little pieces of code). In this case, there is also a scripts directory. Basically, when you get someones's dotfile, you just replace your current config file (which may not exist) for this program with someone's config file, that's how you \"install\" a dot file :)\n\n\\- To customize colors and themes, you'll need to use programs like lxappearance and qt5ct for gtk and qt5 applications, respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. feel free to ask questions :)",

I've had trouble getting Linux to run on my own newer laptop recently, and so I thought I'd test an installerscript or Arch based distro on my desktop PC before pulling the trigger on installing full Arch on it. I read about some different distros but I liked Endeavour because it's really bare-bones compared to many other Arch based distros like Manjaro.

Then identify something you want changed and go through the documentation: [https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) to find what can help you achieve that. \n\nSame goes for polybar, rofi, and compton.

I just didn't have any reason to switch once I started using i3. I actually really like all the customization that it offers. Like varying degrees of CSD, ability to change the background, multiple tabbed sessions within one window. I am sure it isn't the only one with these features but it fills all my needs.\n\nThat said, you are mixing up terminal emulators with shells. Bash, zsh, and fish etc are shells. They are examples of a command language that provide a text based interface with which you can interact with the operating system. Tilix on the other hand is a terminal emulator. It *emulates* a video terminal. And provides a platform on which you can run a shell. As far as shells go they all have their own sets of \"extra\" features. I use zsh.\n\nI have Ubuntu+Manjaro as my flair because I run Ubuntu on my main computer and Manjaro on my secondary computer. The desktop in this post is of my Ubuntu system, which uses i3 as a WM without any DE. My Manjaro installation is however the i3 community edition.\n\nHope that cleared up some stuff!\n\nAnd wow thank you for saying you are fan. Very kind of you :( I appreciate it!",

All of these Picom forks and nobody can manage to merge all of the features into one working branch. Blur + Rounded Corners + Shadows (most of them show square window corner artifacts when using this combination) + Animations... all possible with Wayland+Hyprland.\n\n(2) Picom has trouble blurring the slide-out trays.. I think.. idk I just woke up and might be misremembering\n\nAnd the most important one....\n\n(3). Picom/Xorg (idk which) causes the area where the tray slides out to act like there is a Window there even if the tray is not in it's \"slide-out\" position. This causes any windows in that area to have an unclickable region. Which, I suspect, is why you don't see any Eww-based rice's take advantage of \"revealers\" aka the slide out stuff.

Its basically configured dynamically, and the config file is basically just a script that is executed when wm loads, can be in bash, python or even an executable rust :)\nI think its more 'modular' when it comes to configuration, no keyboard daemon no bar, just a WM. I've tried DWM, it is what you make it to be. Can be dead simple screen or if you have time, you can edit the source and make it Awesome ( a pun btw :p ).\nI personally like the approach bspwm has, dynamic configuration doesn't even needs you to reload the wm. Bspc makes things easy!\n\nThanks for pointing me to the flexipatch, I'll take a look and see if I can configure dwm as per my needs cx.

That being said, I've also been daily driving it for about 9.5 months, so it's not all bad. The regular Pinephone is SLOW, so keep that in mind. For texting and calling it's fine but if you want to search things up you're better off asking someone else to do it for you. That being said, the software on it is becoming much more mature and both Phosh and Plasma Mobile are coming along quite well. I think Plasma Mobile has way more modern features but currently has 1-2 bugs that kinda stop it from being used more, though that's actively being worked on. The Pinephone Pro on the other hand is way faster but the battery life is kinda garbage. At least with Phosh I barely get like 5 hours out of it, though when using my Sway setup I got quite a bit more out of it. Plus there's SXMO which is just basically a window manager on the phone. Ultimately, if you have the money to spare to get a Pinephone and want something that is really cool, then give it a go. If you want something that will work 100% of the time without fail and at a significant speed, probably don't bother. Also, it only has desktop apps, so keep that in mind.",

Don't afraid to make mistakes, if u learn something of 'em.\n\n  \nI used to break my system and erase everything almost every week or so, but now i do not reinstalled my system for almost 5 months. And its completely stable, and i don't think that i'm going to break something in the nearest several months.  \nAlso, u might want to learn more about programming, myself i'm an a nerd, who always wanted to make games (and still want), and i learned a bunch'a stuff before i switched to linux. U just need to understood the way the programmers think and then u can easily learn something like ricing, 'cause most of the time its the easiest syntaxis ever.\n\n  \nI can just wish u good look man!",

Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n\t1.\tPreparation: Understanding the prerequisites, such as partitioning disks, setting up filesystems, and configuring the bootloader, requires a solid foundation in Linux system administration.\n\t2.\tManual Compilation: Compiling packages from source using tools like GCC can be tedious and time-consuming. You must pay close attention to dependencies and compilation flags, which can be challenging for beginners.\n\t3.\tConfiguration: Configuring the system (including the kernel, init system, and user environment) requires a good understanding of system internals. You\u2019ll need to manage configuration files and understand how different components interact.\n\t4.\tTroubleshooting: Encountering errors is common. Resolving issues related to dependencies, missing packages, or build failures can be frustrating, especially without prior experience.\n\t5.\tDocumentation: The LFS book is comprehensive, but it requires careful reading and comprehension. Skipping sections can lead to significant challenges later on.\n\nOverall, while it\u2019s not insurmountably difficult, building an LFS system demands patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to learn. It can be an excellent way to deepen your understanding of Linux, but it\u2019s certainly not a quick or easy process.",

Leveraging the GCC compiler for building various packages allows for substantial customization and a deeper understanding of the system. Transitioning to BLFS for a Bedrock setup is indeed a judicious approach, as it enables the creation of a solid, static foundation that can be finely optimized.\n\nAdditionally, the choice of init system, whether it\u2019s S6 or SysVinit or others, plays a crucial role in how services are managed and how the system operates overall. Thoroughly studying the LFS book is essential; overlooking critical details can lead to significant challenges, especially in configuring the toolchain and managing dependencies. Your experience with LFS, particularly regarding GCC and init systems, certainly adds valuable context to this discussion, emphasizing the depth of knowledge required to navigate such setups successfully.",

        "body": "99.9% of western music (and unfortunately almost all non-western music nowadays) is based on dividing an octave (a doubling in frequency) into 12 equal steps. There is little to reason to do it this way other than the fact that western music has been doing this for hundreds of years. A little while ago western composers began to experiment with notes outside of these 12 and notated them as small deviations of normal notes. This why they got the name microtones. \n\nThe idea of microtonal music is to create music using different notes than the same old 12, for example by dividing the octave in 17 equal steps, or take non-equal steps. This opens a completely new world of musical exploration. If you listen to it for the first time it will sound very wierd, because for your whole life you have been listening to the same 12 notes. Once you get over the initial wierdness you\u2019ll start to appreciate the new harmonic possibilities",

The first thing to get into account is that it will require time, patience and read a lot of documentation pages. If your choice is i3, you can see any video on Youtube or read the [i3 user guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html). After, you have to learn which program does what you want to do. For example, to get transparency, you have to use compton or picom. Or, if you want to edit your terminal, such as URxvt, you need to edit the .Xresources file. If you have any, problem, search it on the internet, and you may found a solution, if you don't have luck, READ THE DOCUMENTATION, very important. I hope this helps, and sory for my English.",

It's been a while since my last post but a lot of work & features have gone into HyprPanel since then.\n\nI've added 25+ pre-built themes into HyprPanel with the help of the community and added more bar modules - up to a total of 20 now.\n\nFor those of you who don't know what Hyprpanel is, you can find more info at https://hyprpanel.com.\n\nTLDR, it's a bar/panel for Hyprland that comes with context menus for common controls, built in notifications and OSDs for volume and brightness. Plus every bit of it is easily customizable through the settings dialog.\n\nI hope you enjoy! If you have any feature requests, please feel free to open an issue on Github https://github.com/Jas-SinghFSU/HyprPanel/issues. Hyprpanel wouldn't be nearly as good if it weren't for such awesome feedback \u2764\ufe0f.",

I've also tried Unity and cinnamon, but less then half of a year all together. It was super hard to switch to KDE, because everything is hidden to various places, and KDE defaults are just awfull. But it is ceranly better in terms of performance. This desktop uses 700 megabytes RAM after boot (without latte it is about 450 maybe), and aweradge usage with firefox and telegram is around 1.5 gigabytes. Gnome uses 970 megabytes from bootup, and about 2+ Gb aweradge. This is nonsece in my opinion. ",

She is web dev, and shes used linux alredy, so we thought it will be nice upgrade and a fine option, because now she will be able to test sites in Safari too. I've done setups there, because I'm far more familliar with nix word then she is, and I've already installed Hackintosh on my laptop while ago (but lack of wifi driver made me switch back to linux later that day). So I've installed various software for web development, and was kinda disappointed with packaging system in OSX. Yes whe have `brew`, and `macports`, which serves us well, but it feels like *small hacks* for **me**. When it comes to installing some console utils I feel like OSX wasn't meant to be used like so. It is not as comfortable as linux in such way. Maybe it's just me though.\n\nThe second moment is the OSX UI itself. OSX DE is great, touchpad gestures, effects, blur, etc. But when it comes to software. Man It is the worst stock applications I've ever seen. Photo viewer can't show more then one photo, finder doesn't sort files by default (maybe there is an option for this, but I didn't find it), and other things I don't remember already. Terminal is bad, but you can replace it with other one, which we can also do in linux. KDE has the most advanced stock apps: Dolphin, Okular, Kate, even Gwenview.\n\nSo combining the above, I'd say that I prefer linux because of packaging system (Arch is the best of what I've tried, also aiming to try out NixOS), and because I can achieve the Mac Os UI expirience in most ways with KDE, I'd stick with such solution.\n\nThere is also one thing: I don't like Macbook's keyboard. Somehow they managed to make THE BEST trackpad/touchpad, but absolutely destroy the keyboard. But that's another story.\n\nEverything above is my honest opinion.",

It all comes down to your personal preferences. My first \"rice\" was on Zorin OS, and it was during that experience that I fell in love with Linux. I started customizing my terminal, learning about new tools, and watching countless YouTube videos. My advice would be to find something that makes you feel comfortable and suits your needs.\n\nLater, I switched to Arch Linux because I wanted to experience a clean installation. I decided to try a big configuration available on GitHub called \"Hyprdots.\" Through this setup, I learned a lot about additional tools and how things work within the .config folder. I approached it by starting with the configuration and tweaking everything I didn't like, essentially working backwards.\n\nI share my experience because I\u2019m still not familiar with configuring other window managers from scratch, but I\u2019m sure you can find something that resonates with you. Many people share their ricings with dotfile repos, which you can try out on virtual machines to see what fits. This is just my method, but others prefer starting from scratch by reading documentation, which definitely takes more time and effort. With the knowledge I\u2019ve gained, I\u2019m now working on my own rice from the ground up, but mostly for fun. At the end of the day, I just need something functional for my daily tasks.\n\nIn conclusion I think that everything you need to start ricing is here, in unixporn!",

Here is my [preconfigured tilda with lyricstify](https://github.com/yusuftaufiq/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_config/tilda/lyricstify_panel). You can view the usage example [here](https://github.com/yusuftaufiq/dotfiles#usage) (in the \"Starting lyricstify as background desktop window:\" section). And when using it you will see something like this on your top panel. [https://i.imgur.com/kQSVGiQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/kQSVGiQ.png)\n* Then, the executor gnome extension with the custom [`gnome-shell.css` ](https://github.com/yusuftaufiq/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_themes/Nordic-persona-5-transparent-center-panel/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css.tmpl) theme is only used for styling purposes to add border styling. In the executor gnome extension, I'm configuring it to print multiple empty strings with `echo \" \"` And it actually just does something like this when the extension is enabled. [https://i.imgur.com/bgJQese.png](https://i.imgur.com/bgJQese.png)\n* Finally, when the previous two steps are combined you'll see it's really like the top panel showing the lyrics and matched to the style of the other left and right panels. [https://i.imgur.com/H31egPI.png](https://i.imgur.com/H31egPI.png)\n\nHope this answers your question.",

Then you're pretty much all set.\n\nNow that I've been using bspwm for some time, I've really been enjoying the reliability and modularity. Especially the fact that the bspwmrc is a shell script is something that is much better than in i3. Nevertheless I still think i3 is very good, especially as one's first WM.",

Atomic Rollbacks - The ability to perform a rollback, in general, is amazing, like, let's say you mess up making a change to your system you can almost always roll back to the last working state. Think of it as checking out an old commit on git but for your system configuration. One thing that this enables you to do is fearless tinkering - fiddle around with (almost) anything and you can just go back.\n2. Declarative config - You can look at the GitHub repo and know exactly what all is in a system. Everything is declared in those configs. All the packages, the config for various stuff, etc. Everything that is required to run the system is there.\n3. I already had experience with FP so learn curve was significantly easier compared to someone who will come to it without that experience. It (experience with FP) also makes it easier to understand (and appreciate) what nix is trying to promise. \n\nI can share a personal experience where these features came together to save me a significant amount of trouble. I am a click-happy dumbass who once nuked my NixOS install when trying to install Windows (only to play games). All I had to do was install NixOS with \\`git\\` and clone my dotfiles repo and after executing 1 or 2 commands my whole system was back to where it was earlier. Even the versions of each software were the same. Now I could achieve this without the need for external tools, arbitrary scripts, etc.  \nNow everything was not devoid of thorns in this journey, but overall at least for me, it was a net positive experience.",

I still have to properly setup i3 and windows, in the screenshot I manually resized them. Overall if you have no.experience with these config files it might take a few days if you want to read documentations and tweak everything as you like, but even much less if you copy some dotfiles instead of writing your own from scratch or much more if you're not really sure what you want and try everything and end up breaking your system various times, which CLEARLY hasn't ever happened to me\n\nEdit cause I forgot: you don't need any programming or scripting skill anyway, you get a pretty intuitive understanding of the syntax of each config file just from reading it.

It's based on Ubuntu so all the documentations about Ubuntu can apply to this distro. I have personnaly try it and it's very robust. It's very important for a beginner to have a good documentation and a lot of forum if you get any issue.\n\nDon't hesitate to watch some video or tutorial and you will be ok. Before the switch, look if you have some essential software and if they exist in Linux. Dual boot with Windows can be a good option to start if you are afraid to have a full transition.

Originally I wanted double borders for dunst as well, but it wasn't possible without changing the source code (I don't know C for squat).  So I used tiramisu ([https://github.com/Sweets/tiramisu](https://github.com/Sweets/tiramisu)) for a while and have notifications directed to my bar, taking the place of date/time whenever a notification pops up. This was when I was still doing a faux double border for my bar. I ended up deciding not to do the double border on the bar and dunst notifications because I thought it was too visually overwhelming anyway. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide note, I use xob to create a  bar to tell me what level my volume/brightness are and that can easily be setup to have double borders, but I decided against it as well as  like I said, I didn't want to overwhelm the viewer with too many borders.

        "body": "Originally I used `xss-lock` with the command `xss-lock <screensaver command> -l -- <lock command>`. If you do it this way, be sure to use `xset` to specify when you want the screensaver and lock to trigger (idle time that is!). Lets say you want the lock to trigger at 10 minutes but you want the screensaver to trigger at 7 minutes. You'll want to use `xset s 420 179` before calling `xss-lock`. You should see the relevant lines in my `bspwmrc`. However, if you're using `light-locker` like I am now (or pretty much any other session locking tool) I use this script, calling it idle.sh:\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    \n    if [ $# -lt 2 ];\n    then\n        printf \"usage: %s minutes command\\n\" \"$(basename $0)\" 2>&1\n        exit 1\n    fi\n    \n    timeout=$(($1*60*1000))\n    shift\n    cmd=\"$@\"\n    triggered=false\n    \n    while true\n    do\n        tosleep=$(((timeout - $(xssstate -i)) / 1000))\n        if [ $tosleep -le 0 ];\n        then\n            $triggered || $cmd\n            triggered=true\n        else\n            triggered=false\n            sleep $tosleep\n        fi\n    done\n\nIt relies on `xssstate` and you use it as such: [`idle.sh`](https://idle.sh) `7 <screensaver command>`. The 7 is for 7 minutes of idle time until the command is executed. This time, you will want to leave `xset` alone! Whichever route you end up taking, make sure that the screensaver window pops up as fullscreen. In bspwm, I have a rule to make the named screensaver window go fullscreen. Here's the screensaver script that I use: [https://github.com/loki7990/Forester/blob/main/.config/bspwm/.screensaver](https://github.com/loki7990/Forester/blob/main/.config/bspwm/.screensaver). It'll pop up a tmux window for each monitor you have connected!",

I have made a [gist](https://gist.github.com/LnLcFlx/e1a0cf379e838dfc41e3e5d72ad78600) with the script. IMPORTANT: It is very crappy and custom and will obviously not work for your setup! I have a `colorscheme` folder in `~/.cache` where the config files for the current are symlinked to. These config files are stored in `~/.resources/colorscheme/[dark,light]/`. The current files in `~/.cache` are then either symlinked themselves to or included in the config files for the respective program. For some programs, the important lines in the config are also changed in place with `sed`. Hope this is useful.",

If you look at my polybar you see the containers are pointing to the middle (depending on the perspective I guess).

First of all i recommend you watch this video to get started with the Awesome Window Manager:\nhttps://youtu.be/qKtit_B7Keo\nhttps://youtu.be/BE87kUCTBVU\n\n\nYou will ignore the system folder, those are just configuration files for some parts of the system, the only one that might be useful for you is the libinput config at \"system/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d\", that file inproves the touchpad gestures in laptops.\n\nNow the user files are meant to go on your home directory, the most important folder is \".config\" and that's were the configuration folder for the Awesome Window Manager is. You could just copy the whole folder and see what happens, but it wouldn't just work. You need to download some dependencies:\n- the git version of the awesome window manager, \"awesome-git\".\n- picom\n- rofi\n- alacritty (the terminal)\n- lxsession\n- the \"gruvbox-dark-gtk\" theme\n- the \"gruvbox-dark-icons-gtk\" icon pack\n- the \"simp1e-cursors\" cursor pack\n- the mononoki nerd font\n\nThe dependencies for the rofi scripts are:\n- fd (a file finder)\n- feh (to set the wallpaper)\n- power-profiles-daemon\n- bluez and bluez-utils (the thing that gives you bluetooth)\n- scrot (for screenshots)\n- NetworkManager (unless you're installing Arch from the ground up, you already have this)\n- xclip (for the clipboard)\n\nYou should copy these files to your home folder:\n- .config\n- .icons\n- .gtk2.0rc\n- .bashrc\n\nIf you don't want to use a login manager like i do you should copy:\n- .xinitrc\n- .bash_profile\n\nAlso watch for more info: https://youtu.be/dtuy09mqBPI\n\nYou should also learn a text editor like Vim or Emacs, but Micro is also a good option for beginners: https://youtu.be/ER5JYFKkYDg\n\n**Keep in mind that you will need to edit my configs to make them your own, specially the keybindings and app selection with the Awesome Window Manager**",

Im not 100% sure that this syntax works for all POSIX shells tho.\n\nAlso when an attacker is able to modify the script located at \"~/.config/i3lock-script\", he can do pretty much anything to your homefolder anyways.\n\nYou are probably right when saying that PAM is the right way to achieve this goal, but I really have no clue how PAM even works so I went for the dirtier option. Also I dont know whether non-root user can configure PAM to do this.",

Then it's even more dangerous if someone gets access to your computer changes your binding to i3lock to include --pass-media-keys and also changes the what the script does. I really see the problem with these options now tho (especially when people upload their dotfiles an attacker can perfectly plan out what to change to access the computer from i3lock).\n\nAside from that I personally find it important to give the user all the power he wants, maybe let him know that it's dangerous on the man-page. \nMaybe you can consider adding functions like --pass-media-keys and --script to your own fork again. But still the choice is yours.",

This would be especially annoying since I use tmux! However, fancy-motd is a faster alternative to individually typing in `df`, `systemctl status ...`, `uptime`, `ip a`, `curl ifconfig.me`, etc to get a quick diagnostic look at my system.\n\nEvery line of the motd is a self-contained script residing within a `modules/`directory that executes a particular task using ordinary Linux tools. These things happen sequentially, with some modules taking longer than others.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what causes latency. One module that is over represented in the execution time is the update module, which queries your package manager. This is not so fast admittedly, but if you don\u2019t want to use it, you can simply remove that particular script from being executed and get a leaner `motd`. \n\n`motd.sh  0.36s user 0.08s system 102% cpu 0.426 total`\n\nThat's more like it.\n\nIf you wanted to run this every log in, then i recommend you see what modules take long for you and tailor accordingly. Fancy-motd is only formatting the output of common Linux commands with little overhead, so it\u2019s just a matter of identifying what you want.",

For one it would need to check if neovim is running and what mode it is in, I suppose that could work as a plugin, but then you have to think about vim motions, parsing a vim motion isn't that hard, but taking existing elements and predicting the next possible keys is. That said some basic motions + a config file would be possible. The real problem is that it would conflict with lighting outside of nvim. For example, you're typing in nvim then go google something and pressing g highlights all keys related to it, or even worse, your regular light controler overrides the nvim one, essentially to make these work together I would have to turn off the this one while nvim is on and, have no other light controler or somehow use i3 integration to tell if the current active window is nvim and apply a whole set of different rules while that's true",

All the games I play just works, where I'm even getting higher FPS on triple A titles. All the apps I use for work, Photoshop, the Affinity Suite of apps, etc. all just work with a simple bash install script you can find with a quick Google or YouTube search.\n\nAnd I figured since I could customize everything, why not try customizing everything lmao. I'd love to hear some thoughts, please don't be too harsh, I'm still new to all this and this rice is just me monke brain Googling what packages people use for what, installing and configuring.",

It handles stuff like creation, removal, category creation/removal, provides an easy interface for editing notes, backing them up (to my Gdrive so I can easily view all the PDFs on my phone whenever I want), and generally making sure that the above guidelines are met at all times (e.g. that deleting a note also deletes the associated PDF file without me having to worry about it). \n\ne.g. if I execute the following: `bote -c linux/tutorials booting` it will create a note called **booting** in the category called *tutorials* (which is itself in a category called *linux*). I don't have to provide any extensions or worry about creating PDF counterparts, that's all handled by the script.\n\nIt may not be as sophisticated as some of the other complex wiki/note-taking systems but it's been fun to mess around with.",

Basically, Python + GTK.\n\nBut it depends on what you want to do and use. You could find other libraries or other bindings for GTK Layer Shell, you could use something else like Quickshell which uses QT and is configured with QML.\n\nYou can also use AGS, which is GTK configured with GJS, which is practically JavaScript.\n\nAnd yes, a lot of CSS. heh",

Reddit, YouTube, hell just random pictures I find on google that inspired me and piecing together all of them and learning how to do it. I guess that\u2019s part of the fun in ricing. If you would like to really learn how to do it I suggest just starting with one component. Pick a part of the setup and see how to customize that. Look at the posts you save, open the dotfiles, go through them, edit them and see how it works. It\u2019s all trail and error and eventually you\u2019ll understand what you have and how to change it to your liking. It\u2019ll take time though. Most of this is just going through man pages, editing files and learning stuff, that\u2019s it. \n\nSorry if I rambled on too much :)",
